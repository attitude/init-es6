$ initES6
=========

***Init anÂ empty ES6 project with opinionated defaults***

> Read more about how it works and what's included
> at [Medium](https://martinadamko.medium.com/inites6-d43dce14bd15).

Usage
-----

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:attitude/init-es6.git new-project-dir
$ cd new-project-dir
$ ./initES6.sh
```

You can also use `-y`/`--yes` to skip the questionnaire altogether. However you will be **always promted to enter remote** for newly initalized Git repository.

The `initES6.sh` script and the `.git` directory will be finally removed.

---

Enjoy!
